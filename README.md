# E-commerce-Web-Application
E-commerce Web Application using Jenkins Pipeline ,docker
ShopEase Inc. is a growing e-commerce startup specializing in sustainable and eco-friendly products. As our development team frequently pushes updates to the backend application (built with Python or another chosen language), manual deployments have become error-prone and time-consuming. This leads to version mismatches, delayed hotfixes, and downtime during peak shopping hours, negatively affecting the user experience and revenue.

To address these challenges, we have implemented a fully automated CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins Pipelines. This ensures that every time a developer commits code to the GitHub repository, the application is built, tested, and deployed seamlessly.

🚀 Key Features

-Automated Build & Testing: Ensures code quality and reliability before deployment.

-Continuous Integration: Detects changes in the repository and triggers builds automatically.

-Continuous Deployment: Deploys the latest version of the application with zero downtime.

-Containerization: Uses Docker for consistency across environments.

-Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Automates provisioning with Kubernetes and Ansible.

-Security & Compliance: Incorporates security scanning tools into the pipeline.

-Monitoring & Logging: Integrates with Prometheus and Grafana for real-time insights.
